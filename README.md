# flower_recognition
 This project aims to detect the classification of various flowers. The dataset was acquired from Kaggle. In this dataset, there are 5 classes of flowers (Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip), and for each class, there are about 800 images. The recognition was done by selecting and training a sequential model using the aforementioned dataset.
